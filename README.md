## Problem Statement

### Objective:
Design a **user-centric journey** for Tide’s financial services marketplace, focusing on **Business Loans** or **Loan Against Property (LAP)**. The interface should:
1. Minimize friction in the application process.
2. Reduce time-to-loan approval through an intuitive flow.
3. Encourage repeat usage and engagement with the platform.

### Scope:
Participants are required to create a **comprehensive, screen-by-screen mockup** of the entire user journey, starting from the landing page to loan disbursement. The journey should include:
- **Landing Page** → **Loan Selection** → **Eligibility Check** → **Credit Score Info** → **Offers Page** → **Application** → **Approval** → **Disbursement**.

The focus should be on **Business Loans** or **Loan Against Property (LAP)** (choose one).
